# Cosmos-Docs

This repository contains user documentation for cosmos cloud. Written in markdown and compiled into a static site using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/)

The documentation itself can be found at <https://cosmos-cloud.io/doc>.

## Installing

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** - `v18.14.1` or higher.
- **Text editor** - We recommend either [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Official Astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the [Unofficial Astro Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20959-astro)
- **Terminal** - The documentation is built and run through its command-line interface (CLI).

To get all the dependencies installed, run this command in the terminal:

Running both these commands in the terminal, will install the dependencies required for the docs and run a local environment on your machine.
